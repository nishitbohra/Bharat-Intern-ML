# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a wine quality prediction project. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a wine is of "good" or "bad" quality based on various features.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: The initial phase of the project involved thorough exploration of the dataset. Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and unveil potential patterns.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Selection**: For this project, we chose the Random Forest algorithm due to its ability to handle both classification tasks and complex feature interactions.

4. **Model Training**: The selected model was trained on the training dataset, and its hyperparameters were tuned to optimize performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix to assess its predictive performance.

6. **Prediction**: New input data could be provided to the model for prediction, and the model would classify the wine as "good" or "bad" quality.
